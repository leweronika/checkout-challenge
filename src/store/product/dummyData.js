        "Bought this for a star wars fan. It is a small box so I would not have paid the recommended retail price for this. This was discounted on here which is why I snapped it up as a stocking filler. Was easy to assemble and no parts was missing. The box was slightly dented when it arrived but that was probably down to packing from amazon, not a problem though. Once completed it can just sit there.",

        "*This is no reflection on the product or the seller this is purely based on the amazon packaging and delivery experience.* \nThe product itself I can't speak for, as it is a gift for someone who lives these little collectibles. On the note of collectable, packing and its condition is a big factor for collectors. This came crushed and pretty much fully opened... none of the items inside seem damaged or open. The fact remains that I am not happy with the packaging and shipping this item received.\nHopefully the gift will be still be okay for the recipient. Otherwise I shall be requesting a refund.\nValue for money...its about 12pence cheaper than anywhere else so it is what it is.\nAll lego products are of a high quality so you get what you always would with any other product they make.",
